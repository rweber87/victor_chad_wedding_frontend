	        	<p>Once upon a time, in the distant suburbs of Atlanta, there stood an elementary school. Murphy Candler Elementary in Lithonia, Georgia. Local parents would send their very young children there to spend their days with strange adults learning about beauty and culture. On the third Thursday morning in January of 2002, two of these adults came to Murphy Candler to ply their trades in beauty and culture. One, Victor Clark, was the music teacher at this school. He had long locks of beautiful hair, and drove a used Jeep Cherokee. The other, Chad Zodrow, was the stage manager for a touring kiddie van show. He would drive the van with the scenery and wardrobe to elementary schools all over Georgia, with a cast of 3 performing Mozart in gymnasiums and cafetoriums. He wore overalls. Some witnesses claim he had a stalk of hay in his mouth, but that cannot be verified.</p>
	        	<p>Upon completing the 45-minute show, Chad and his colleagues prepared to leave. Victor was very friendly and helpful. Chad, in his brazenness, asked Victor if he could share his phone number with him. Get to know the local hangouts. Victor, with his sense of propriety, abruptly walked away, saying nothing. Chad wondered if perhaps he had forgotten his place, among these young children gathering for lunch. This may not be the right setting to make this sort of connection. Before the load out was complete, Victor returned. He handed Chad a piece of paper, saying nothing. This paper contained his home phone number, his mobile phone number, and his email address. The message was clear: keep in touch.</p>
	        	<p>Luckily for them, they did.</p>
